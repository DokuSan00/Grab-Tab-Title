# Grab-Tab-Title
My first ever web-browser extension. It works but it is **sh\*\*ty** **(@-@)**.

## Context:
#### I do streaming video games sometimes for fun. I listen to music while I play, and I want to show the music's title on my stream. I knows Spotify does support that, however, sadly I don't use any music application besides youtube. So, here I am!
- Goals
  1. Display my current playing music's title on stream (OBS)
  2. Update the title automatically whenever the music change
  3. Can toggle on/off
  4. No VIRUS!!!! ( I mean I built it for myself. Who would want virus on their machine :expressionless: I'm not rich )

## What is this application:
It's a web-browser extension that allows me to capture the title (html) of the page/tab and use it for my purposes

## What this app does specifically:
Once this application is activated. It will target the **1st tab** in my browser (not anything else. Therefore I must have the youtube as **1st tab**).

1. The application sits there patiencely and creepily stares at the link, eyes open widely and no blinking.
2. If there is a change in the title, even a single pixel, the application will catch it and disect it's organs ( I'm exaggerating =D )
3. It checks if the link is what it've been looking for. The links, must be video link ( check the text after "**youtube.com/**" ), not homepage nor channels ... etc
4. If the link is lovely or cute to it, the application will extract the title and memorise it
5. The application will then _henshin_ the title and save it in the computer as a text file.

## To display it in OBS:
1. I added a text element to the scene
2. I ticked "Read from file"
3. Gives it the file!
4. And it works

What if the file is deleted during use? Well... farewell!

## Author notes:
It is **sh\*\*ty**. 
Personally, I think the application uses too much string comparison function, and I don't like it. Maybe I'm too harsh, but I think it could be better.
So, overall, it is **sh\*\*ty** as stated.
